<h2>Hello there, I'm <u>Nino</u> üëã</h2>
 
> I love crafting Software and mentoring peers.

After completing my studies in **Theoretical Physics**, I leaped into **Software Engineering** in 2019,
turning a long-time hobby of tinkering with **Linux**, **LaTeX**, and **Wolfram** into a fulfilling career.
I'm passionate about building scalable, _distributed systems_, set up _automation_, and bringing _structure to complex data_ problems.

üíº As a **Big Data Engineer** at [AgileLab](https://www.agilelab.it/), I work at the intersection of **DevOps**, **Data Engineering**, and **Platform Development**, crafting integrations for banking and insurance clients using tools like **Kubernetes**, **Airflow**, **Kafka**, **Spark**, and **React**.

üß† My physics background sharpened my analytical thinking. When I step out of my (**Zsh**) shell, I apply it to write clean, domain-driven, testable code in **Python**, **Java**, **TypeScript**, and **Scala**.

üöÄ I enjoy tinkering with tooling and infrastructure (**Helm**, **Terraform**, **Jenkins**, **GCP**, **AWS**) and am always eager to streamline developer experience, improve observability, and bring DevOps best practices to teams.

üß™ I switch SQL dialects as projects demand and have experience across **OLTP**, **OLAP**, **NoSQL**, and **graph** databases.

üé§ Giving back to the community, I mentor fellow engineers by crafting tech articles. You'll find me around local meetups and conferences about testing, observability, and API design‚Äìoccasionally speaking (see [talks](#-past-talks)). Not as much as I wish to, I try to contribute to open-source projects every now and again.

‚öôÔ∏è Currently leveling up in **Rust**, **Go**, and **Lua**. And yes, I still typeset in **LaTeX**, but I‚Äôm excited to give **Typst** a try.
