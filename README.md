# About me

> **Please, call me Nino**

I studied Theoretical Physics and jumped into Software Engineering in 2019.
Turning my hobby for tinkering with my pc into a career.
Since then, I’ve been thriving in Platform and Data Engineering roles,
yet I’m always eager to pitch in on DevOps or Full Stack challenges whenever given the chance.

When I step out of my (zsh) shell, I love building software in Python, Typescript, Java and Scala, switching SQL dialects as projects demand.
I try to write testable software, and the first thing I learn when I pick up a new language is what test framework to use.
I’m excited to level up in Rust, Go, and Lua. I still type away in LaTeX, and I’m looking forward to giving Typst a spin.

Outside of coding, you’ll find me mentoring by crafting technical articles for my company and speaking at community events.
